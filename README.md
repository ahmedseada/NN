# NeuralSharp

A self-contained neural network library for **.NET 10**, written in pure C#. There is **no TensorFlow.dll,
no NuGet dependencies and no native libraries of its own**. It includes N-D tensors with automatic
differentiation; dense, convolutional, recurrent and transformer layers; regression and classification
losses; optimizers with learning-rate schedules; a training loop; data loading; resource limits; and
telemetry hooks.

| Backend | How it works | Requirements |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **CPU** | `Vector<T>` SIMD kernels (AVX2/AVX-512/NEON), a register-blocked matrix multiply, multi-threading for large tensors, pooled buffers | Any machine running .NET 10 |
| **CUDA** | P/Invoke straight into the NVIDIA **driver** API (`nvcuda.dll` / `libcuda.so.1`). The GPU kernels are PTX assembly generated in C# (`PtxKernels.cs`), and the driver JIT-compiles them for the installed GPU | An NVIDIA GPU and display driver. No CUDA Toolkit, cuBLAS, cuDNN or NVRTC |

`Device.Default` picks the first GPU when a driver is present and falls back to the CPU otherwise.
Set `NEURALSHARP_DISABLE_CUDA=1` to force the CPU.

### Train and predict modes

Every console sample trains, saves its model under `models/` (next to the executable), and can then run
**inference only** from the saved model:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.HousePrices                       # train + save
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.HousePrices -- --predict --input "2100,4,2,15,9.5,7,2,0,6500"
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.Sequences -- --predict --input "the movie was not good;not bad at all"
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.Ocr -- --predict --input "HELLO WORLD 2026"
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.Ocr -- --predict --image scan.pgm
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.ReRanker -- --predict --input "how many people live in armor"
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.Summarizer -- --predict --input "the lions played the owls in kelso on friday . the owls scored 2 goals . the lions scored 4 goals ."
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.Transformer -- --predict --input "the old wizard " --temperature 0.8
```

| Sample | `--input` in predict mode |
|--------|---------------------------|
| `Xor` | `"a,b;a,b"` bit pairs |
| `HousePrices` | 9 features per house, `;` between houses (or `--data file.csv` to price every row) |
| `Classification` | `"x,y;x,y"` points in [-1, 1] |
| `Images` | shape names to draw and classify, e.g. `"circle,cross"` |
| `Sequences` | sentences separated by `;`, judged by all four saved models side by side |
| `Ocr` | text to render and read (or `--image file.pgm`) |
| `Transformer` | prompt to continue (`--length`, `--temperature`, `--top-k`) |

Everything a model needs at inference time is saved next to its weights. That includes the scalers for
house prices, the BatchNorm running statistics, and the GPT's vocabulary and architecture (a `.json`
file). `--model <path>` chooses another location.

### GPT Web API

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.GptApi
# http://localhost:5080         inference UI
# http://localhost:5080/scalar  API reference (Scalar)
```

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/status` | Loading / Training (with live progress) / Ready / Failed |
| `GET /api/model` | parameters, blocks, heads, width, context, vocabulary, validation results, layer summary |
| `GET /api/devices` | CPU and CUDA GPUs with memory usage and the active one |
| `POST /api/generate` | one or more samples, each character's probability, entropy, top-5 alternatives and latency, plus aggregate metrics (including decoding mode) |
| `POST /api/generate/stream` | the same as server-sent events: `token` events (with their sample index) every `chunkSize` characters, then `metrics` |

The request body is `{ "prompt", "length", "temperature", "topK", "seed", "device": "cpu" | "cuda",
"samples", "useCache", "useGraph", "chunkSize" }`. The UI has matching controls: a samples slider
(shown as tabs), and KV cache and CUDA graph switches for comparing modes.
The device can change per request, and the model moves between CPU and GPU as needed.

The service loads `Gpt:ModelPath` from `appsettings.json`. Point it at a model saved by the
`Transformer` sample (or pass `--Gpt:ModelPath path`). When no model exists, the service trains one in
the background and reports progress through NeuralSharp telemetry.

The browser UI (`wwwroot/index.html`, dark and light themes, responsive) is laid out in two columns:
- **Left:** the streamed output, with each character coloured by the model's confidence (hover a
  character for its alternatives, click it for the token inspector); metric cards for throughput,
  total time, first-token latency, time per token, confidence, perplexity, entropy and device
  memory; and live confidence and latency charts.
- **Right:** prompt, length, temperature, top-k, seed and streaming controls; the CPU/GPU switch; and
  the model's parameters and layer summary.

All samples take the same options:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.HousePrices               # GPU if available, else CPU
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.HousePrices -- --cpu      # force CPU
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.HousePrices -- --cuda     # force GPU
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.Xor -- --help
```

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `--device auto\|cpu\|cuda\|cuda:N`, `--cpu`, `--cuda` | where to run |
| `--threads N` | CPU threads to use (default: all cores) |
| `--gpu-memory MiB`, `--cpu-memory MiB` | cap tensor memory (default: unlimited) |
| `--epochs N`, `--batch-size N` | training settings |
| `--log training,batches,gradients,layers,operations,inference,all` | what the console logger prints |
| `--log-file run.jsonl` | also write telemetry as JSON Lines |
| `--data path.csv` | dataset file (house prices) |

The house-price sample loads `data/houses.csv`: 2,500 synthetic but realistic listings with 9 features
(area, bedrooms, bathrooms, age, distance to the city centre, quality, garage, pool, lot size).
It splits them 80/20, standardizes features and prices, and trains a 9→64→32→1 network with
dropout, Adam and early stopping. It then reports test error in dollars, prices three new listings,
and saves the weights, scalers and a training-history CSV. A typical CPU run reaches **R² ≈ 0.97 and
about 5% mean error** in about a second, close to the ±6% noise built into the data.

## Using the library

### Training with the `Trainer`

```csharp
using NeuralSharp;
using NeuralSharp.Data;
using NeuralSharp.Layers;
using NeuralSharp.Optimizers;
using NeuralSharp.Training;

var data = Dataset.LoadCsv("houses.csv", new CsvOptions { TargetColumns = ["price"], IgnoreColumns = ["id"] });
var (train, test) = data.Split(0.8, seed: 1);

var x = StandardScaler.FitFeatures(train);
var y = StandardScaler.FitTargets(train);
var trainLoader = new DataLoader(train.Scale(x, y), batchSize: 64, shuffle: true);
var testLoader  = new DataLoader(test.Scale(x, y), batchSize: 512);

using var model = new Sequential
{
    new Linear(data.FeatureCount, 64), new ReLU(), new Dropout(0.05f),
    new Linear(64, 32), new ReLU(),
    new Linear(32, 1),
};

var trainer = new Trainer(model, new Adam(model.Parameters(), 2e-3f), Losses.MeanSquaredError)
{
    Metrics = { Metric.MeanAbsoluteError },
    EarlyStoppingPatience = 30,             // restores the best weights when it stops
};
TrainingHistory history = trainer.Fit(trainLoader, epochs: 400, validation: testLoader);
float[,] predictions = trainer.Predict(test.Scale(x, y));
```

### Low-level: tensors and a hand-written loop

```csharp
var a = Tensor.From(new float[,] { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } }, requiresGrad: true);
var loss = (a.MatMul(a).Relu() * 2f + 1f).Mean();
loss.Backward();                      // a.Grad holds d(loss)/da

for (int epoch = 0; epoch < 1000; epoch++)
{
    using var scope = new TensorScope();   // releases this iteration's tensors
    var l = Losses.MeanSquaredError(model.Forward(inputs), targets);
    optimizer.ZeroGrad();
    l.Backward();
    optimizer.Step();
}

using var prediction = model.Predict(inputs);   // evaluation mode, no gradients
```

### Classification

Classifiers output raw scores (logits). `CrossEntropy` applies log-softmax itself, which is more
stable than a separate softmax layer. Add `Softmax` only when you want probabilities at inference time.

```csharp
var data = Dataset.FromClassLabels(features, labels, classes: 3);      // one-hot targets
// or: Dataset.LoadCsv(path, new CsvOptions { TargetColumns = ["label"] }).ToOneHot(3)

var trainer = new Trainer(model, new AdamW(model.Parameters(), 1e-3f), (p, t) => Losses.CrossEntropy(p, t))
{
    Metrics = { Metric.Accuracy },
    Scheduler = new CosineAnnealing(optimizer, totalEpochs: 100, warmupEpochs: 5),
};
using var probabilities = model.Predict(x).Softmax();
using var classes = probabilities.ArgMax();
```

For two classes with one output column, use `Losses.BinaryCrossEntropyWithLogits` and
`Metric.BinaryAccuracy(threshold: 0)`.

### Images (CNN)

```csharp
var images = Dataset.FromClassLabels(pixels, labels, 10).WithFeatureShape(1, 28, 28);   // batches are [N, 1, 28, 28]
var cnn = new Sequential
{
    new Conv2d(1, 32, kernelSize: 3, padding: 1), new BatchNorm(32), new ReLU(), new MaxPool2d(2),
    new Conv2d(32, 64, kernelSize: 3, padding: 1), new BatchNorm(64), new ReLU(), new MaxPool2d(2),
    new Flatten(), new Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 128), new ReLU(), new Dropout(0.3f), new Linear(128, 10),
};
```

`Conv2d` unfolds image patches (im2col) and runs one large matrix product on the same optimized GEMM
as `Linear`, on both CPU and GPU.

### Sequences (RNN and transformer)

Token ids go in as floats, shape [batch, time]:

```csharp
var lstm = new Sequential
{
    new Embedding(vocabulary, 64), new LSTM(64, 128), new Linear(128, classes),   // LSTM returns the last state
};

var transformer = new Sequential
{
    new Embedding(vocabulary, 64), new PositionalEncoding(maxLength, 64),
    new TransformerEncoderLayer(64, heads: 4), new TransformerEncoderLayer(64, heads: 4),
    new LayerNorm(64), new Lambda(x => x.Mean(1), "MeanOverTime"), new Linear(64, classes),
};
```

Use `LSTM(..., returnSequences: true)` or `GRU` for per-step outputs. `MultiHeadAttention(dim, heads, causal: true)`
masks future positions for autoregressive models. Setting `Trainer.MaxGradientNorm` clips gradients,
which recurrent networks usually need.

### Tensor operations

N-D tensors support batched `MatMul` (with transpose flags), `Permute`, `Transpose`, `Narrow`,
`Tensor.Concat`, `Tensor.Stack`, `Flatten`, `Sum(dim)`, `Mean(dim)`, `Softmax`, `LogSoftmax`,
`ArgMax`, `Exp`, `Log` and `Gelu`. Adding a tensor whose shape matches the trailing dimensions
broadcasts it, as with a bias [F] over [N, F] or a mask [T, T] over [B, T, T]. All of these are
differentiated automatically.

### Other number types

Every kernel computes in float32, the standard for neural networks and the only type with fast
SIMD and GPU paths everywhere. Data of any numeric type converts at the edges:

```csharp
using var t = Tensor.From<double>(doubles, [rows, cols]);   // also int, long, byte, Half, decimal, ...
using var m = Tensor.From(new int[,] { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } });
int[] ints = t.ToArray<int>();                               // saturating, truncating conversion
```

### Fast autoregressive generation

Generating text one token at a time is dominated by overhead rather than math, so NeuralSharp provides
three tools that work together (`CharGpt.Generate` in `samples/Shared/Gpt` shows them in use):

* **KV cache.** Pass a `DecodingContext` to `Sequential.ForwardCached(ids, context)`. The prompt is
  processed once (prefill), then every step processes only the newest token, while each attention
  layer's keys and values accumulate in a `KeyValueCache`. `MultiHeadAttention`,
  `TransformerEncoderLayer` and `PositionalEncoding` implement `ICachedModule`.
* **On-device sampling.** `TokenSampler` draws the next token (temperature, top-k, top-p, min-p,
  repeat/presence/frequency penalties over a device-side history of recent tokens) on the device
  that holds the logits and writes each token's probability, entropy and top-5 alternatives to a
  device buffer. The next step therefore needs no host round trip; `Read` fetches the statistics in
  chunks. Its randomness is counter-based (seed, step, row), so results are reproducible and match
  between CPU and GPU.
* **Compute graphs.** `DecodingContext.CaptureStep(step)` records a whole decoding step, and
  `ReplayStep` runs it again with one launch; on CUDA this is a CUDA Graph. The position counter,
  causal mask and cache offsets are computed on the device, so one recording is valid at every
  position. On the CPU, or if the driver refuses, replay simply re-runs the step.
* **Batching and fused kernels.** Many samples decode together as one batch. During inference,
  scale+mask+softmax, LayerNorm and bias+GELU each run as a single kernel; training uses the
  differentiable path.

Measured on the sample GPT (341K parameters) on a 4-core CPU container
(`dotnet run --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.Transformer -- --predict --benchmark true`):

| Mode | chars/s | Speedup |
|------|---------|---------|
| Full recompute, 1 sample | 283 | 1× |
| KV cache, 1 sample | 4,119 | 14.5× |
| KV cache, 8 samples | 6,595 | 23× |
| KV cache, 32 samples | 8,957 | 32× |

On a GPU, CUDA graphs remove the per-step launch cost, and batching keeps the GPU busy.

### Text generation, chat and tools (`NeuralSharp.Generation`)

A higher-level layer on top of the cache, sampler and graphs, with the options and conventions of common
local LLM servers:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ITokenizer`, `CharTokenizer`, `WordTokenizer` | text ↔ token ids (characters; words, numbers, punctuation and `<special>` tokens) |
| `GenerationOptions` | `Temperature`, `TopK`, `TopP`, `MinP`, `RepeatPenalty`, `RepeatLastN`, `PresencePenalty`, `FrequencyPenalty`, `Seed`, `NumCtx`, `NumPredict`, `Stop`, plus `UseCache`, `UseGraph`, `ChunkSize` |
| `TextGenerator` | streams a continuation: prompt truncated to `NumCtx`, sliding context window, stop sequences (never partially emitted), done reason `stop` / `length`, prompt and generation timings |
| `ChatMessage`, `ToolDefinition`, `ToolCall` | conversations with `system`, `user`, `assistant` and `tool` roles, and function tools |
| `ChatTemplate`, `ChatMLTemplate` | renders a conversation and its tools as the prompt (Qwen-style ChatML: `<think>`, `<tool_call>`, `<tool_response>`); `think: false` closes an empty reasoning block |
| `ChatOutputParser` | splits streamed output into reasoning, answer and tool calls (JSON), holding back partial tags |
| `ChatGenerator` | chat = template + generator + parser; streams `ChatChunk`s and ends with the full assistant message and statistics |
| `ModelHost<T>`, `KeepAlive` | keeps models loaded and unloads each one when its keep-alive (`"30m"`, `"1h30m"`, `300`, `0`, `-1`) expires |

```csharp
var chat = new ChatGenerator(new TextGenerator(model, new CharTokenizer(vocabulary), contextLength: 256));
var request = new ChatRequest(
    [new ChatMessage("system", "You are a helpful assistant."), new ChatMessage("user", "What is the latest Ollama version?")],
    Tools: [new ToolDefinition("web_fetch", "Fetch a page.", JsonNode.Parse("""{"type":"object","properties":{"url":{"type":"string"}}}"""))],
    Think: true,
    Options: new GenerationOptions { Temperature = 1f, TopK = 20, TopP = 0.95f, NumCtx = 4096, NumPredict = 2048 });
foreach (var chunk in chat.Stream(request))
    Console.Write(chunk.Delta.Thinking + chunk.Delta.Content);   // chunk.Delta.ToolCalls: completed tool calls
```

### Ollama-compatible chat API

The GPT Web API also serves `POST /api/chat` with the Ollama request body: `model` (any name selects the
served model), `messages`, `stream` (NDJSON, default true), `think` (true/false or low/medium/high),
`keep_alive`, `options` (the keys above in snake_case; other keys are accepted and ignored) and `tools`.
Replies have Ollama's shape: `message.content`, `message.thinking`, `message.tool_calls`, `done`,
`done_reason` and nanosecond `total_duration`, `load_duration`, `prompt_eval_count`,
`prompt_eval_duration`, `eval_count`, `eval_duration`. `GET /api/tags`, `GET /api/ps` (loaded models with
`expires_at`) and `GET /api/version` are there too.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5080/api/chat -d '{"model":"any","stream":true,"think":true,"keep_alive":"30m",
  "options":{"temperature":1,"top_k":20,"top_p":0.95,"num_ctx":4096,"num_predict":2048},
  "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is the latest Ollama version?"}],
  "tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"web_fetch","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"url":{"type":"string"}}}}}]}'
```

The GptApi sample maps these endpoints with `app.MapOllamaApi(...)` from `NeuralSharp.AspNetCore` (see
below); the request body is read as JSON whatever its Content-Type, as Ollama does. The endpoint serves
`Gpt:ChatModelPath` if that file exists, otherwise `Gpt:ModelPath`. A model trained on
plain text only continues text. To see reasoning and tool calls, train the small chat model on synthetic
ChatML transcripts (reasoning, `web_fetch` calls, answers citing tool results):

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project samples/NeuralSharp.Samples.Transformer -- --chat true   # saves models/chat.weights and runs a two-turn demo
```

### Optimizers and schedules

`Sgd(momentum, weightDecay)`, `Adam(weightDecay)` (L2) and `AdamW` (decoupled weight decay) are
available, together with the `StepDecay`, `ExponentialDecay`, `CosineAnnealing(warmupEpochs)` and
`LambdaSchedule` schedulers. `optimizer.ClipGradientNorm(max)` and `optimizer.GradientNorm()` work
in hand-written loops too.

## Two ways to write it: the original API and the simplified API

Everything above keeps working exactly as shown. The simplified API is a second way to write the same
things with less code: each builder step or extension method makes the same calls you would write by
hand, with the same parameters and the same defaults. Nothing is chosen for you, and whatever the
original API requires is still required. The tests check that both ways give identical weights,
outputs and training histories.

### Networks: a fluent builder (the input size of each layer comes from the previous layer)

```csharp
// original
var model = new Sequential
{
    new Linear(9, 64, random: r), new ReLU(), new Dropout(0.05f, r),
    new Linear(64, 32, random: r), new ReLU(),
    new Linear(32, 1, random: r),
};

// simplified: same layers, same weights with the same seed
var model = Network.Input(9).Seed(1).Linear(64).ReLU().Dropout(0.05f).Linear(32).ReLU().Linear(1).Build();

var cnn = Network.Image(1, 16, 16)
    .Conv2d(16, kernelSize: 3, padding: 1).BatchNorm().ReLU().MaxPool2d(2)
    .Conv2d(32, kernelSize: 3, padding: 1).BatchNorm().ReLU().MaxPool2d(2)
    .Flatten().Linear(4)                                   // 32·4·4 inputs worked out for you
    .Build();

var gpt = Architectures.Gpt(vocabulary: 76, context: 64, dim: 96, heads: 4, layers: 3, ffDim: 384, dropout: 0.1f).Build();
var layers = Blocks.Repeat(3, () => new TransformerEncoderLayer(96, 4, 384, 0.1f, causal: true));   // in a new Sequential { ... }
```

`Network.Input / Image / Tokens / Sequence` start a builder; every layer has a method (`Linear`, `Conv2d`,
`LSTM`, `GRU`, `TransformerEncoderLayer`, `Embedding`, `PositionalEncoding`, `LayerNorm`, …) plus
`MeanOverTime`, `LastStep`, `FirstStep`, `Reshape`, `Lambda(fn, name, outputShape)` and `Add(module, outputShape)`.
Shape mistakes fail while building, with a clear message. `ToJson()` / `Network.FromJson(...)` describe and
replay a network; packages use this to store the architecture.

### Data: extension methods

```csharp
// original
var (train, test) = data.Split(0.8, seed: 1);
var fs = StandardScaler.FitFeatures(train);
var ts = StandardScaler.FitTargets(train);
var trainLoader = new DataLoader(train.Scale(fs, ts), 64, shuffle: true);

// simplified: fitted on the training part, applied to both parts
var split = data.Split(0.8, seed: 1).StandardizeFeatures().StandardizeTargets();   // or NormalizeFeatures()
var trainLoader = split.Train.Batches(64, shuffle: true);                          // = new DataLoader(...)
// split.Train, split.Test, split.FeatureScaler, split.TargetScaler
```

### Training: factories for the wiring, and one settings object

```csharp
// the trainer creates the optimizer and schedule from factories, and disposes them
using var trainer = new Trainer(model, Losses.CrossEntropy,
    optimizer: p => new AdamW(p, 0.003f, weightDecay: 1e-4f),
    scheduler: o => new CosineAnnealing(o, 40, warmupEpochs: 1));

// or everything as one record; the required members are what Trainer and Fit require
var run = new TrainingRun
{
    Model = model, Loss = Losses.CrossEntropy, Optimizer = p => new AdamW(p, 0.003f),
    Train = split.Train.Batches(64, shuffle: true), Validation = split.Test.Batches(500), Epochs = 40,
    Metrics = [Metric.Accuracy], MaxGradientNorm = 1f,
};
TrainingHistory history = run.Fit();
var clipped = run with { MaxGradientNorm = 0.5f };                    // a variant (give it a fresh Model)

await run.FitAsync(new Progress<EpochCompleted>(e => label.Text = $"epoch {e.Epoch}: {e.Loss:F4}"), token);
await foreach (var e in run.TrainAsync()) { if (e.ValidationLoss < 0.01) break; }   // leaving the loop stops training
```

### Telemetry: one builder, one disposable

```csharp
await using var telemetry = Telemetry.Configure()
    .Console(TelemetryLevel.Training, epochInterval: 10)                 // = new ConsoleLogger(...)
    .JsonLines("run.jsonl", TelemetryLevel.All & ~TelemetryLevel.Operations)
    .Record(out var recorder)                                            // = new MetricsRecorder()
    .Start();
```

### Predicting: a predictor instead of scale → tensor → predict → unscale

```csharp
var predictor = Predictor.For(model)
    .Input<House>(h => [h.Area, h.Beds, h.Baths, h.Age, h.Distance, h.Quality, h.Garage, h.Pool, h.Lot])
    .ScaleInputs(featureScaler)
    .UnscaleOutputs(priceScaler)
    .Output(v => v[0])
    .Build();
float price = predictor.Predict(house);                      // or Predict(listOfHouses): one batched call

var classifier = Predictor.For(model).Input<string>(Encode).Softmax().Classes(["negative", "positive"]).Build();
ClassPrediction answer = classifier.Predict("not bad at all");   // .Class, .Probability, .Scores

predictor.Save("house-price.nsm");                            // weights, architecture (if built with Network), scalers, settings
```

### Model packages: one file instead of several

```csharp
ModelPackage.Create("model.nsm")
    .Architecture(network).Weights(model)                    // the existing formats, zipped together
    .Scaler("features", featureScaler).Tokenizer("words", tokenizer).Json("settings", settings)
    .Save();

using var package = ModelPackage.Open("model.nsm");
using var model = package.BuildNetwork();                   // no layer code needed
var generator = package.TextGenerator("words");              // model + tokenizer + context from one file
```

`MinMaxScaler`, `CharTokenizer` and `WordTokenizer` now have `Save` / `Load` too.

### The inference engine: one reusable place for loading, batching and serving

```csharp
await using var engine = await InferenceEngine.Create()
    .Predictor<House, float>("house-price", "models/house-price.nsm", p => p
        .Input<House>(h => [h.Area, h.Beds, h.Baths, h.Age, h.Distance, h.Quality, h.Garage, h.Pool, h.Lot])
        .Output(v => v[0])
        .WarmUp(sampleHouse)                                           // each feature is off unless set
        .Batching(maxBatch: 256, maxWait: TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(5)))
    .ChatModel("my-gpt", "models/chat.nsm", "chars", c => c
        .Instances(2)                                                  // two generations at once
        .KeepAlive(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)).QueueLimit(32).Timeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)))
    .Telemetry()
    .BuildAsync();                                                     // or .LoadOnFirstUse()

float p = await engine.PredictAsync<House, float>("house-price", house);
await foreach (var chunk in engine.StreamAsync("my-gpt", "Once upon a time", options)) Console.Write(chunk.Text);
await foreach (var result in engine.PredictManyAsync<House, float>("house-price", millionsOfHouses, batchSize: 1024)) { … }
var models = engine.Models;                                            // loaded state, running and queued requests, expiry
var stats = engine.Stats("house-price");                               // requests, latency (average, p95), rows/s, batch size
```

Predictors run concurrently (they are thread-safe); a text or chat copy runs one generation at a time
(it owns its KV cache). Models come from a package, a factory, a model object or a network builder
plus a weights file.

### Chat: conversations and tools

```csharp
public sealed class ReleaseTools(HttpClient http)
{
    [Tool("latest_release", "Fetch the release notes page of a product.")]
    public Task<string> LatestAsync([Description("Product name, e.g. ollama.")] string product) =>
        http.GetStringAsync($"https://{product}.com/releases");
}

var tools = ToolRegistry.Create()
    .Add(new ReleaseTools(http))                                        // every [Tool] method; schema from the parameters
    .Add(WebTools.Fetch(http, allow: u => u.Host == "ollama.com", maxCharacters: 4000))   // built-in, allowlist required
    .Allow("web_fetch", args => ((string)args["url"]!).StartsWith("https://ollama.com"))
    .RequireApproval("delete_file", (call, token) => AskUserAsync(call, token))
    .Timeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)).Parallel()
    .Build();

var conversation = Conversation.For(chatGenerator)       // or engine.Conversation("my-gpt", c => ...)
    .System("You are a helpful assistant. Cite sources as [1], [2].")
    .Think(true).Tools(tools).MaxToolRounds(5)             // MaxToolRounds is required when tools are added
    .Build();
var reply = await conversation.SendAsync("What is the latest Ollama version?");   // runs the tool loop
```

Arguments are validated against each tool's schema before the tool runs; mistakes go back to the model as
an error it can correct. `FakeChatModel.Script(...)` replays scripted replies for testing tool code, and
`TextGenerator.StreamAsync` / `ChatGenerator.StreamAsync` stream with `await foreach`.

### ASP.NET Core: the optional `NeuralSharp.AspNetCore` package

```csharp
builder.Services.AddNeuralSharp()
    .AddPredictor<House, float>("house-price", "models/house-price.nsm", p => p.Input<House>(h => [...]).Output(v => v[0]))
    .AddChatModel("my-gpt", "models/chat.nsm", "chars", c => c.KeepAlive(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)));

app.MapPredictor<House, float>("/predict/house-price", "house-price");      // POST a House (or /batch an array)
app.MapGenerate("/api/generate", "my-gpt");                                 // JSON, or server-sent events with "stream": true
app.MapOllamaApi("/api", "my-gpt", o => o.Tools(ToolExecution.Client));    // or ToolExecution.Server with maxRounds
app.MapNeuralSharpStatus("/status");
```

The endpoints are ordinary ASP.NET Core endpoints (`.RequireAuthorization()`, rate limiting and OpenAPI work
as usual), and `IPredictor<TIn, TOut>` can be injected (keyed by model name). The GptApi sample serves its
Ollama-compatible API this way, and the HouseApi sample is a complete prediction API in about ten lines.

### Retrieval and RAG (`NeuralSharp.Retrieval`)

These are new building blocks; the original way is writing the search, the scoring loop and the prompt by hand.

```csharp
var encoder = new TextEncoder(model, tokenizer, maxLength: 20, padId: 0);     // token ids → unit vectors (masked mean)
encoder.Train(pairs, epochs: 20, batchSize: 64, p => new AdamW(p, 2e-3f), temperature: 0.05f, seed: 3);   // in-batch negatives

var index = RetrievalIndex.Create()
    .Documents(documents, ChunkUnit.Sentences, size: 1, overlap: 0)          // or .Add(chunks)
    .Bm25(k1: 1.2, b: 0.75)                                                  // keyword search
    .Embeddings(encoder)                                                     // vector search
    .Fusion(k: 60, depth: 20)                                                // required when both are on
    .Build();
index.Save("towns.index");                                                   // RetrievalIndex.Load(path, encoder)

var rag = Rag.For(chatModel)                                                 // any IChatModel: ChatGenerator, engine model, fake
    .Retrieve(index, top: 10)
    .Rerank(new CrossEncoder(scorer, encodePair, pairShape: [36]), keep: 3)   // optional
    .Prompt((question, passages) => ...)                                     // optional (Rag.DefaultPrompt)
    .Build();
var answer = await rag.AskAsync("who is the mayor of armorden");           // answer.Text, answer.Cited, answer.Passages

var tools = ToolRegistry.Create().Add(RetrievalTools.Search(index, 3, "search_towns", "Searches facts about towns.")).Build();
```

`Bm25Index`, `VectorIndex` (exact SIMD search, dot or cosine, save/load) and `Chunker.Split` can also be used on
their own.

### MCP: the optional `NeuralSharp.Mcp` package

```csharp
await using var files = await McpTools.ConnectStdioAsync("npx", ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"]);
var tools = ToolRegistry.Create()
    .Add(await files.ListToolsAsync(prefix: "fs_"))                         // the server's tools as NeuralSharp tools
    .RequireApproval("fs_write_file", (call, ct) => AskUserAsync(call, ct))
    .Build();                                                                // use in a Conversation, the engine or MapOllamaApi

options.ToolCollection = [.. McpTools.ServerTools(registry)];                // or serve a registry to MCP clients
```

`ConnectHttpAsync(uri)` and `ConnectAsync(transport)` connect to other servers. The package depends on
`ModelContextProtocol.Core`; the core library stays dependency-free.

### Quantization: int8 weights, half-precision files

```csharp
model.QuantizeInt8();                          // every Linear: 1 byte per weight + 1 scale per output column (¼ of the memory)
model.QuantizeInt8(l => l.OutFeatures > 64);   // or only some layers
model.Save("model.nsw");                       // int8 stays int8; a float model built the same way loads it (and becomes int8)
model.Save("model.f16.nsw", WeightFormat.Float16);   // or BFloat16: half-size files, float32 again after loading
package.Weights("model", model, WeightFormat.BFloat16);

model.QuantizeInt8();                          // QLoRA-style fine-tuning: frozen int8 weights,
model.AddLora(rank: 8, alpha: 16, targets: _ => true, freezeBase: true);   // trainable float adapters on top
model.DequantizeInt8();                        // float weights again (the rounding stays)

var generator = new TextGenerator(model, tokenizer, 256) { CacheFormat = KeyValueFormat.Int8 };   // int8 KV cache
using var context = new DecodingContext(device, batch: 4, capacity: 2048, KeyValueFormat.Int8);   // or directly
```

Int8 layers read their bytes directly when few rows go through them (token-by-token generation, where reading
weights is the bottleneck), and dequantize once per call for larger batches. Gradients flow through them, so
layers before them and LoRA adapters on them still train. ONNX export writes the dequantized weights. Biases,
normalization, embeddings and convolutions stay float32. The int8 KV cache stores each head's keys and values
at every position as bytes plus one scale (17/64 of the memory at head size 64); attention reads the bytes
directly, and recorded CUDA graphs work with it.

### ONNX: the optional `NeuralSharp.Onnx` and `NeuralSharp.Onnx.Runtime` packages

```csharp
model.ExportOnnx("house-price.onnx", 9);                                  // one sample is [9]; the batch stays dynamic

OnnxExport.For(model).Input(28)                                          // or configure the export
    .Names("ids", "logits").Metadata("tokenizer", "words")
    .Lambda("ClsToken", OnnxExport.FirstStep)                             // your own lambdas need a translator
    .Save("reranker.onnx");

using var imported = OnnxImport.Load("model.onnx", Device.Cuda());       // .onnx → NeuralSharp layers, on NeuralSharp's CUDA kernels
imported.Model.Predict(input);                                          // a Sequential: predict, fine-tune (LoRA), move devices
imported.SavePackage("model.nsm");                                      // architecture + weights; Predictor.Load("model.nsm", device)

using var onnx = OnnxModule.Load("model.onnx");                          // or run the file with ONNX Runtime (CPU package)
```

`NeuralSharp.Onnx` has no dependencies: it reads and writes the protobuf itself. **Export** covers Linear (LoRA
adapters merged), activations, Softmax, BatchNorm, LayerNorm, Conv2d, pooling, Flatten, Embedding,
PositionalEncoding, attention, transformer layers, LSTM, GRU and the builder's shape helpers. **Import** turns a
chain of those layers into a `Sequential` (with its `Network` builder), and anything else into a `GraphModule`:
layers where the importer recognizes them (Conv, BatchNorm, MatMul/Gemm → Linear, attention, LSTM/GRU, …) and graph
operations for the rest (skip-connection Add, Concat, Mul, Reshape, Transpose, Squeeze/Unsqueeze, Slice, Gather,
ReduceMean, and shape arithmetic such as PyTorch's flatten, computed for any batch size). So ResNet-style models
with skip connections and branches import too. Exact GELU becomes the tanh approximation and is listed in
`Notes`; an operator with no NeuralSharp equivalent is reported by name. Imported models are ordinary NeuralSharp
models: they run on NeuralSharp's own CPU and CUDA backends, can be fine-tuned, and save as `.nsm` (graphs included).

`NeuralSharp.Onnx.Runtime` references `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime`, which is ONNX Runtime's **CPU** build; running
ONNX Runtime on a GPU needs its `.Gpu` (CUDA) or `.DirectML` package instead. `OnnxModule` works with predictors,
the inference engine and the ASP.NET Core endpoints. The tests run every exported layer in ONNX Runtime and
import it back, and both must match NeuralSharp within 1e-4.

### Fine-tuning: freezing, a learning rate per group, saving only what changed, LoRA

```csharp
model.Freeze(0..^1);                                           // every layer but the last (= RequiresGrad = false)
using var trainer = new Trainer(model, Losses.MeanSquaredError, p => new Adam(p, 1e-3f));   // p = trainable parameters only
model.SaveTrainable("head.nsp");                               // only the head; LoadTrainable restores it

var grouped = new GroupedOptimizer(new AdamW(body.Parameters(), 1e-4f), new AdamW(head.Parameters(), 1e-3f));

gpt.AddLora(rank: 8, alpha: 16, targets: layer => true, freezeBase: true);   // adapters on every Linear, outputs unchanged at start
// ... train: only the adapters change; SaveTrainable stores just them ...
gpt.MergeLora();                                                // fold them into the weights
```

## Telemetry: logging and tracking

Every step of training and inference is published to a hub, and you choose what to listen to.
Hooks are **zero-cost when nothing is subscribed**. Each publishing site checks one static field
with a bitwise AND, and no event is built or allocated unless some hook asked for that level.

```csharp
using NeuralSharp.Diagnostics;

using var a = Telemetry.Subscribe(new ConsoleLogger(TelemetryLevel.Training, epochInterval: 10));
using var b = Telemetry.Subscribe(new MetricsRecorder());                        // in memory, SaveCsv()
await using var file = new JsonLinesLogger("run.jsonl", TelemetryLevel.All);     // background writer
using var c = Telemetry.Subscribe(file);
```

| Level | Event | Data |
|-------|-------|------|
| `Training` | `TrainingStarted`, `EpochCompleted`, `TrainingCompleted` | model summary, device, sizes; per-epoch loss, metrics, validation loss/metrics, learning rate, duration, samples/s, memory, best flag; early-stop info |
| `Batches` | `BatchCompleted` | epoch, batch, global step, batch loss, learning rate, data-wait time, compute time |
| `Gradients` | (adds to `BatchCompleted`) | global gradient L2 norm |
| `Layers` | `LayerForward` | layer name/type, nesting depth, input and output shapes, time, train/eval mode |
| `Operations` | `OperationCompleted` | every tensor op, forward and backward (∇), shape, device, time |
| `Inference` | `InferenceCompleted` | model, samples, shapes, device, latency, samples/s |

**Custom hooks.** Implement `ITelemetryHook`, set `Levels`, and override only the methods you need.
The other methods default to no-ops. Events are `readonly record struct`s passed by `in`, so they
are not copied or boxed.

```csharp
sealed class SlackAlert : ITelemetryHook
{
    public TelemetryLevel Levels => TelemetryLevel.Training;
    public void OnEpochCompleted(in EpochCompleted e) { if (double.IsNaN(e.Loss)) Alert("loss diverged"); }
}
```

**Why synchronous hooks plus an optional `Channel`.** A direct interface call is the fastest possible
dispatch, with no queueing, allocation or thread hop. Hooks that do slow work, such as files,
databases or HTTP, should use `ChannelTelemetry`. It copies each event into a bounded `Channel`
that never blocks training (the oldest events are dropped when it is full), and your consumer reads
it with `await foreach`. `JsonLinesLogger` is built this way.

GPU work is asynchronous, so layer and operation timings measure launch time by default. Set
`Telemetry.SynchronizeForTiming = true` when profiling to get true execution times.

## Data loading

* `Dataset.LoadCsv(path, options)` reads numeric CSV files. Lines are parsed in parallel, and errors
  name the line and column. `Dataset.FromArrays` and `Dataset.FromFlat` build a dataset from memory.
* `Split`, `Subset` and `Scale` return new, immutable datasets.
* `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` are fitted on training data. They provide `Transform` and
  `InverseTransform` (to turn predictions back into real units), plus `Save`/`Load` for deployment.
* `DataLoader` batches and shuffles data and moves each batch to the device. For large batches, the
  next batch is gathered on a worker thread while the current one trains, using double-buffered
  prefetch.

## Resources and parallelism

```csharp
ComputeResources.MaxCpuThreads  = 4;                   // default: every core
ComputeResources.GpuMemoryLimit = 2L << 30;            // bytes per GPU; default: unlimited
ComputeResources.CpuMemoryLimit = 1L << 30;            // default: unlimited
MemoryUsage usage = ComputeResources.GetMemoryUsage(Device.Default);   // in use / cached / limit
ComputeResources.ReleaseCachedMemory();
```

By default nothing is reserved up front, and memory is allocated as the network needs it. Freed blocks
are cached and reused, so a training loop stops allocating after its first iteration. Going over a
limit first releases the cache, then throws `ResourceLimitExceededException` with a clear message.

Parallelism is used where it pays off:

* SIMD in every CPU kernel.
* Multi-threaded kernels above 65,536 elements, and a multi-threaded matrix multiply for large
  products. On 4 AVX2 cores, a 1024×1024 multiply reaches about 86 GFLOP/s.
* Parallel CSV parsing.
* Background batch prefetch.
* On the GPU, thousands of threads per operation. Loss and metric sums stay on the device, so each
  epoch needs only one synchronization.

Everything on the CPU respects `MaxCpuThreads`, and small tensors stay single-threaded because
scheduling would cost more than it saves.

## NPU support

NPUs (Intel AI Boost, AMD Ryzen AI / XDNA, Qualcomm Hexagon) are **not supported**, and they cannot be
supported under this library's no-dependency rule:

* Unlike NVIDIA GPUs, which accept PTX through the driver, NPUs expose no general-purpose instruction
  set. They only run networks compiled by the vendor's own toolchain: OpenVINO for Intel, Ryzen AI /
  Vitis AI for AMD, QNN for Qualcomm, or DirectML / Windows ML on Windows.
* Those toolchains are the "prebuilt libraries" the project excludes.
* Current NPUs are mostly inference engines (INT8/FP16) and do not support training.

The backend design (`Backends/Backend.cs`) leaves room for an optional add-on package, for example
`NeuralSharp.OpenVino`, that runs inference on an NPU while the core stays dependency-free.

## Tests

```bash
dotnet run -c Release --project tests/NeuralSharp.Tests
```

There are 104 tests. They cover reference comparisons for every kernel (matrix products, softmax,
convolution and pooling against direct implementations) and finite-difference gradient checks for
every op and layer, including their weights. They also cover end-to-end learning (regression, spiral
classification, a CNN, LSTM and transformer sequence models), optimizers and schedules, CSV parsing,
data loading, telemetry, memory limits and thread budgets, the sampler's filters and penalties, and the
generation layer (stop sequences, context sliding, cache/graph/recompute agreement, template rendering,
streaming parser, keep-alive expiry). The simplified API is tested against the original one (identical
layers, weights, data splits and training histories), together with predictors, packages, tools,
conversations, the inference engine (batching, copies, queue limits, timeouts, keep-alive with a manual
clock) and the ASP.NET Core endpoints over a real Kestrel server. Retrieval is checked against the formulas
(BM25 scores, masked mean pooling, reciprocal rank fusion), MCP tools round-trip through an in-process
server, every layer exported to ONNX gives the same output in ONNX Runtime and after importing it back, and
int8 products (both kernels) and half-precision files are checked against float32. The suite runs on every available device; `NS_FILTER=text` runs only the tests whose name contains it.

## Status

* **Verified on real hardware.** 95 of the 104 tests pass on both the CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050
  Laptop GPU (Blackwell), 190 of 190 (the newest nine, graph import and quantization, pass on the CPU and still need a GPU run), including KV-cache and batched decoding, graph replay, the
  sampler with top-p, min-p and penalties, the generation layer, the kernel-signature check, the
  simplified API, fine-tuning and LoRA, predictors, packages, tools, the inference engine, retrieval,
  and ONNX export and import (imported models run on the GPU). The ASP.NET Core and MCP tests do not
  depend on the device and run once, on the CPU.
  That covers every GPU kernel: matrix products, softmax,
  normalization, embeddings, convolution, pooling, recurrent and attention layers, and end-to-end
  training of classifiers, a CNN, an LSTM and a transformer.
* Every kernel launch is checked against the kernel's declared parameter count, and parameter names are checked for duplicates. The 64 GPU kernels also assemble without errors for sm_50, sm_75, sm_89 and sm_120 (checked with
  `ptxas` 12.9), covering Maxwell through Blackwell.
* Everything computes in float32. Tensors hold up to 2³¹ elements, and embedding ids must be below
  2²⁴ (the largest integer a float stores exactly).
* Small models such as the samples are dominated by kernel-launch overhead on the GPU. Recurrent
  models are hit hardest, since they launch kernels for every time step. The GPU pays off with wide
  layers, large batches and convolutions: the CNN test trains faster on the RTX 5050 than on a
  16-thread CPU.
