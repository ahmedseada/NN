/// A recorded sequence of device work that can be replayed with a single launch. On CUDA this is a CUDA Graph:
/// the ~hundreds of small kernel launches of, say, one transformer decoding step become one
/// <c>cuGraphLaunch</c>, removing nearly all CPU launch overhead. On the CPU (or if recording fails) replaying
/// simply runs the step again, so code using graphs works everywhere.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A recorded step must be replayable as-is: kernel arguments (sizes, offsets, scalars) are frozen at recording
/// time, so anything that changes between replays must live in device memory (e.g. a position counter updated by
/// the step itself). The step must not copy data from the host or read results back while recording, and the
/// tensors it uses (weights, caches, input and output buffers) must stay alive and on the same device.
